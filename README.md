# Business Problem üñáÔ∏è üìù

The project aims to develop a model that can predict the probability of customers opening a deposit account. In this way, it aims to create effective marketing campaigns for customers who are likely to open a potential deposit account.

The results obtained in this project showed great potential in the field of data analytics and machine learning and I hope it can make a great contribution in increasing the effectiveness of future marketing strategies.
